# Verification-Based NFT Minting Workflow

## Overview
The Dright platform now implements a comprehensive verification-based NFT minting system where NFTs are only created for fully verified rights, ensuring legal compliance and authenticity.

## Workflow Process

### 1. Right Creation
- Users create rights through the platform
- YouTube content can be auto-verified during creation
- Non-YouTube content remains in "pending" verification status
- NFTs are only minted for verified rights

### 2. Verification States
- **Pending**: Right awaits admin verification (default for non-YouTube content)
- **Verified**: Right has been approved by admin and is eligible for NFT minting
- **Rejected**: Right verification was denied, no NFT can be minted

### 3. Admin Verification Process
- Admins review pending rights in the admin panel
- When admin marks a right as "verified":
  - Verification status updates to "verified"
  - Automatic NFT minting process initiates
  - Right becomes tradeable on the marketplace

### 4. Automatic NFT Minting
- Occurs automatically when verification status changes to "verified"
- Creates Hedera NFT with IPFS metadata
- Records blockchain data in database
- Links NFT to original right for complete traceability

## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Rights table includes verification fields
verification_status: "pending" | "verified" | "rejected"
hedera_token_id: VARCHAR (Hedera token identifier)
hedera_serial_number: INTEGER (NFT serial within token)
hedera_transaction_id: VARCHAR (Mint transaction hash)
hedera_metadata_uri: VARCHAR (IPFS metadata URI)
hedera_account_id: VARCHAR (Current NFT holder)
hedera_network: VARCHAR (testnet/mainnet)
```

### API Endpoints
- `POST /api/admin/rights/{id}/verify` - Admin verification endpoint
- `POST /api/rights/{id}/mint-nft` - Records NFT mint data
- `GET /api/rights/{id}` - Includes verification and NFT status

### Frontend Components
- `AutoNFTMinter` - Handles automatic minting when rights become verified
- `HederaNFTCard` - Displays verification status and NFT information
- Admin panel with verification workflow integration

### Hedera Integration
- NFT minting only for verified rights
- IPFS metadata storage with legal documents
- Blockchain verification and ownership tracking
- Explorer links for transaction transparency

## Security Features

### Legal Compliance
- Clear verification requirement before NFT creation
- Unverified content explicitly marked as such
- Admin oversight for all verification decisions
- Audit trail of verification actions

### Blockchain Security
- Immutable NFT records on Hedera
- Cryptographic proof of ownership
- IPFS content addressing for tamper-proof metadata
- Multi-signature support for high-value rights

### Platform Protection
- Only verified content can generate NFTs
- Admin authentication with session timeouts
- Transaction logging and monitoring
- Automatic verification for YouTube content where possible

## User Experience
