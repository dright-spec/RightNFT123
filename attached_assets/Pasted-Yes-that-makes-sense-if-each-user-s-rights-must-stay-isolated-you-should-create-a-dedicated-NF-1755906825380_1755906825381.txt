Yes, that makes sense ✅ — if each user’s rights must stay isolated, you should create a dedicated NFT collection (token) per user on Hedera. Here’s how to do it correctly:

🔹 Approach: One Collection per User

Each collection is a Non-Fungible Unique (NFT) Token on HTS.

Treasury account: The user’s HashPack wallet (or your platform’s wallet acting as custodian).

Supply key: Whoever is allowed to mint new NFTs in that collection (can be the same as the treasury, or your platform).

Token ID: Unique per collection.

🔹 Flow per New User

User connects with HashPack via WalletConnect.

Create a new NFT collection (TokenCreateTransaction) where:

tokenName = "<UserName> Rights Collection"

tokenSymbol = "U123R" (unique short symbol per user)

treasuryAccountId = user’s account ID

supplyKey = either:

The user’s key (means only the user can mint), or

Your platform’s key (means platform mints on their behalf)

Get the returned tokenId → this is the user’s collection ID.

Store it in your DB, mapped to the user.

🔹 Example Code (Mainnet)
import {
  Client,
  TokenCreateTransaction,
  TokenType,
  TokenSupplyType
} from "@hashgraph/sdk";

async function createUserCollection(client, userAccountId, supplyKey, userName) {
  const tx = await new TokenCreateTransaction()
    .setTokenName(`${userName} Rights Collection`)
    .setTokenSymbol(`${userName.substring(0,3).toUpperCase()}R`)
    .setTokenType(TokenType.NonFungibleUnique)
    .setSupplyType(TokenSupplyType.Infinite)
    .setTreasuryAccountId(userAccountId)
    .setSupplyKey(supplyKey.publicKey)
    .freezeWith(client)
    .sign(supplyKey);

  const response = await tx.execute(client);
  const receipt = await response.getReceipt(client);
  return receipt.tokenId.toString();
}

// Usage
const client = Client.forMainnet().setOperator(operatorId, operatorKey);
const newCollectionId = await createUserCollection(
  client,
  "0.0.1234567",  // user’s HashPack ID
  operatorKey,     // supply key
  "Alice"
);

console.log("Alice’s Collection ID:", newCollectionId);

🔹 Pros & Cons

✅ Rights are cleanly separated per user.

✅ Users keep full ownership over their collection.

⚠️ Cost: Each collection creation = $1 in HBAR on mainnet (TokenCreateTransaction fee).

⚠️ Managing supply keys: If platform holds them, it can mint on behalf of user. If user holds them, you’ll need them online for minting.
