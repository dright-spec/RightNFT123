 Rights Marketplace – Technical Concept Overview
🔹 Goal
Create a user-friendly web3 platform where users can tokenize specific rights (e.g. copyrights, income rights, ownership claims) into ERC-721 NFTs. Each NFT represents a specific right and includes embedded metadata describing the type of right, whether it generates income/dividends, and any associated legal agreements.

🔹 Core Concept
Each NFT = One Specific Right

Example: “Streaming royalty rights to Song XYZ,” or “25% profit share in Property ABC.”

Rights Metadata Must Include:

✅ Type of right: Copyright, income share, access right, etc.

✅ Description: What the right actually allows or entitles.

✅ Dividend status: Whether it pays passive income (yes/no).

✅ Source of dividends: URL or address of payment stream (e.g. Superfluid, Juicebox, contract address).

✅ Legal agreement hash: PDF with terms, uploaded to IPFS.

🔹 Workflow Summary
🟢 Step 1: Right Creation Flow (Minting)
User fills a short form:

Upload document (optional)

Title of right

Type of right (select dropdown: Copyright, Royalty, Access, etc.)

Description

Check: "Does this pay dividends?" → If yes, enter payment address and frequency

Upload legal agreement (PDF) → stored on IPFS

System mints ERC-721 NFT:

Stores the metadata as JSON on IPFS

Links the NFT’s tokenURI to that JSON

Optionally stores hashed legal doc on-chain

🔵 Step 2: Rights Display & Marketplace
Marketplace page shows:

Thumbnail / title

Type of right (with emoji/symbol)

📄 = Copyright

💰 = Royalty income

🔐 = Access right

Dividend status: ✅/❌

Right summary (short description)

View button for full metadata

NFT Detail Page:

NFT owner

Full metadata (type, dividend, frequency)

IPFS link to legal doc

“Buy Right” button (fixed or auction)

🔁 Optional Add-Ons
Superfluid / custom payment stream integration to send royalties to the current token holder

ERC-2981 royalty metadata for resale royalties

GraphQL indexer (via TheGraph or Alchemy) for fast search/filter

🔹 Smart Contract Requirements
✅ ERC-721 contract with tokenURI support

✅ Mint function that accepts:

title, type, description, dividendStatus, paymentAddress, legalDocHash

✅ Royalty logic (ERC-2981 optional)

✅ Event emissions for indexing: RightCreated, RightSold, RoyaltyPaid
