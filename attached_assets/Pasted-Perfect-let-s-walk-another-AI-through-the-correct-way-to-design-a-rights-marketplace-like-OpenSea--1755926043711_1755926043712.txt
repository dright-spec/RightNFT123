Perfect, let’s walk another AI through the correct way to design a rights marketplace (like OpenSea, but for rights on Hedera) so it avoids INVALID_TOKEN_ID and achieves a good UX.

🔹 Root Cause of Your Error

INVALID_TOKEN_ID means the token doesn’t exist on Hedera (or the wrong ID was used).

This happens if:

You didn’t persist/store the tokenId from TokenCreateTransaction.

You tried minting into a token collection that was never created, deleted, or mismatched between mainnet/testnet.

So the fix: always confirm `TokenCreateTransaction → tokenId → store in DB → reuse that ID for minting.

🔹 Marketplace Architecture Choices
Option 1: Use HTS directly (no custom contract)

Hedera’s Token Service (HTS) natively supports NFTs.

You can:

Create collections per user (or one global collection per asset type).

Mint NFTs with HIP-412 metadata (JSON with rights info).

Transfer NFTs between accounts.

✅ Benefits:

No smart contract gas headaches.

Cheaper fees.

Native HashPack support.

⚠️ Limitations:

Marketplace logic (listing, bidding, royalties) must be off-chain in your app’s backend.

You enforce rules (e.g., “royalty to creator”) by building them into UI/backend, not blockchain logic.

Option 2: Deploy a Marketplace Smart Contract

Write a Solidity contract on Hedera EVM that:

Manages NFT listings (price, currency).

Enforces royalties & transfers automatically.

Handles escrow of NFTs + payment tokens.

✅ Benefits:

On-chain trustless execution.

Closer to OpenSea’s model.

⚠️ Downsides:

Higher fees (smart contract calls).

Users must approve contract interactions.

Slower development, more complexity.

🔹 Recommendation for You

Since this is a rights marketplace, where compliance & clarity matter more than full decentralization:

Use HTS directly for minting NFTs

Each NFT = one right (with HIP-412 JSON metadata: title, type of right, duration, jurisdiction, etc.).

Each user has their own collection or you create sub-collections grouped by type.

Handle listings/trades off-chain (like Rarible did early on)

Backend stores "User X listed NFT Y for 100 HBAR/USDC".

Buyer clicks “Buy” → triggers TransferTransaction from seller to buyer.

Payment handled via HTS fungible tokens or HBAR.

Only move to smart contracts if you need:

Automatic escrow.

Royalty enforcement at the protocol level.

🔹 UI/UX Recommendations

WalletConnect Flow

On first load: show “Connect HashPack” (via WalletConnect modal).

After connect: display user’s account ID & owned NFTs.

Minting Flow

Show a simple “Create Right NFT” form:

Title of Right

Type (copyright, succession, property, etc.)

Metadata fields (HIP-412 JSON builder)

On submit → backend generates metadata JSON, stores on IPFS, calls TokenMintTransaction.

Marketplace Flow

For sellers: “List NFT” → backend registers listing, doesn’t move NFT yet.

For buyers: “Buy NFT” → UI prompts HashPack to approve payment + transfer NFT.

Confirmations shown in-app with a progress loader → success toast with Hedera Explorer link.

Error Handling

If INVALID_TOKEN_ID → show “This collection does not exist. Please create a new NFT collection first.”

Always surface transactionId + explorer link.

🔹 Metadata Standard (HIP-412 for Rights NFTs)

Example JSON you’d pin to IPFS:

{
  "name": "Copyright for Book X",
  "creator": "Alice",
  "type": "Copyright",
  "jurisdiction": "US",
  "valid_until": "2030-12-31",
  "description": "Exclusive copyright rights for the novel 'Book X'.",
  "files": [
    { "uri": "ipfs://QmExampleFile", "type": "application/pdf" }
  ],
  "attributes": [
    { "trait_type": "Right Type", "value": "Copyright" },
    { "trait_type": "Transferable", "value": "Yes" }
  ]
}


✅ Summary for the other AI:

Use HTS (not smart contracts) to mint & transfer NFTs for rights.

Persist token IDs to avoid INVALID_TOKEN_ID.

Handle listings off-chain for now (simpler + cheaper).

Build UI around WalletConnect, IPFS metadata, and clean error handling.
